    "## Variables and Aesthetics:\n",
    "It is sth like change data dimensions to the x,y coordinates or colour etc., to map variables to aesthetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variables** can be categorized:\n",
    "    * Numerical, categorical\n",
    "    * Continuous, discrete\n",
    "    * Ordered, unordered\n",
    "* **Aesthetics** are not created equal:\n",
    "    * Ordered, unordered\n",
    "    * Position and length most accurate\n",
    "    * Area and volume not so good\n",

    "## Colour\n",
    "* different people seeing colour is different, It is based on type of vision: Trichromatic, Dichromatic, Monochromatic and Tetrachromatic vision.\n",
    "* Colour is 3 dimensional: RGB or HSV or HSL\n",
    "* context dependent perception\n",
    "* Colour scales (aka color maps, aka colour palettes), can be used for categorical variables(order, unorder)\n",
    "* Perceptually uniform colour maps, which is colour-blind-friendly, grayscale compatible.\n",
    "* Keep in mind that should choose color scales carefully:\n",

    "1. Know the context and what you want to say. (Message, audience, means of communication)\n",
    "2. Keep it simple\n",
    "    * Remove useless chart junk\n",
    "    * Maximize data-ink ratio (within reason)\n",
    "    * Design should be simple so data can be complex\n",
    "    * If possible, avoid legends directly include labels in plot\n",
    "3. Guide attention (to whether is important for your message)\n",
    "4. For the graph content: induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than others and avoid distorting information.\n",
